3. Here, we'll configure Anything to PDF event parameters. In "Source Type", we'll select option which specifies "Link to image or multiple links to images with comma as a separator". In "Input" field, we'll add image URLs in a comma separated format. Lastly in "Name" field, we'll add output file name.
