##### **app.js:**
    
```
// Please NOTE: In this sample we're assuming Cloud Api Server is hosted at "https://localhost". 
// If it's not then please replace this with with your hosting url.

// `request` module is required for file upload.
// Use "npm install request" command to install.
var request = require("request");

// Direct URL of source PDF file.
const SourceFileUrl = "https://bytescout-com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/demo-files/cloud-api/pdf-to-text/sample.pdf";

// Comma-separated list of page indices (or ranges) to process. Leave empty for all pages. Example: '0,2-5,7-'.
const Pages = "";

// PDF document password. Leave empty for unprotected documents.
const Password = "";

// Search string. 
const SearchString = '[4-9][0-9].[0-9][0-9]'; // Regular expression to find numbers in format dd.dd and between 40.00 to 99.99

// Enable regular expressions (Regex) 
const RegexSearch = 'True';

// Prepare URL for PDF text search API call.
var query = `https://localhost/pdf/find`;
let reqOptions = {
    uri: query,
    formData: {
        password: Password,
        pages: Pages,
        url: SourceFileUrl,
        searchString: SearchString,
        regexSearch: RegexSearch
    }
};

// Send request
request.get(reqOptions, function (error, response, body) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error("Error: ", error);
    }

    // Parse JSON response
    let data = JSON.parse(body);
    for (let index = 0; index < data.body.length; index++) {
        const element = data.body[index];
        console.log("Found text " + element["text"] + " at coordinates " + element["left"] + ", " + element["top"]);
    }
